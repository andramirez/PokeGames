# Documentation - PokeGames!
### 03/27/17 CST 438 Project 3
## Developers

# What does your app do?
### We aim to deliver a real-time arena-type strategy game. The web app will provide social login to allow users to easily identify themselves, and include features such as a chat room, a game master chatbot, the game itself, an event log, and a media player to go along with our game.
### The goal of the game will be to traverse a digital grid in search of pokemon and items in order to out-survive and out-battle all the other players and be the last one standing.

# Who worked on it?

### Javar Alexander:
### Dante Lacey-Thompson:
=======
### Javar worked on some design aspects of the game, along with integrating spotify api, and the sockets for a collaborative listening envoirment for spotify. Users connected to a specific game/lobby will listen to the same songs. Users can select and search for songs. For this handin, there is only a static pokemon album shown which will be changed in later handins.                                      
### Katelynn set up the basic framework for the game. Added the early visuals for the game board. She set up the python scripts and the webpage shells.                                                                                                                          
### Andrea helped katelynn set up the webpage shells for the game. Implemented PokeAPI, worked on Documentation and set up the PokeGames Set-Up page                                                                                                                         

### Dante worked on some design aspects of the page. CSS, and was the go-to debugger for the application. Also helped with setting up the initial sockets in the game.

# What were you able to complete for this handin?
### For this handin, we were able to set up the basic layout for our web game. We also were able to implement the spotify API. Since the theme is pokemon, we have a pokemon album queued up on spotify where users can listen to and game. 

# What are known problems, if any, with your project?
### Right now, there is a login glitch with spotify. Where it's prompting the user to sign in when selecting a song. Most likely due to an Oauth token error. Still researching


# How would you improve it if you had more time?
### If given more time, we would have liked to change more of the Set-Up Page, as well as the overall look of the game page. We would have liked to add more features at this point, but with the base that we have, we will be able to add the features that we initially wanted for the game page.
