# Documentation - PokeGames!
### 04/10/17 CST 438 Project 3
## Developers
### Katelynn Jones
### Andrea Ramirez 
### Dante Lacey-Thompson
### Javar Alexander


# What does your app do?
### We aim to deliver a real-time arena-type strategy game. The web app will provide social login to allow users to easily identify themselves, and include features such as a chat room, a game master chatbot, the game itself, an event log, and a media player to go along with our game.
### The goal of the game will be to traverse a digital grid in search of pokemon and items in order to out-survive and out-battle all the other players and be the last one standing.

# Who worked on it?
### Javar worked on some design aspects of the game, along with integrating spotify api, and the sockets for a collaborative listening envoirment for spotify. Users connected to a specific game/lobby will listen to the same songs. Users can select and search for songs. For this handin, there is only a static pokemon album shown which will be changed in later handins.                                      
### Katelynn set up the basic framework for the game. Added the early visuals for the game board. She set up the python scripts and the webpage shells.                                                                                                                          
### Andrea helped katelynn set up the webpage shells for the game. Implemented PokeAPI, worked on Documentation and set up the status bar that changes dynamically as the user gains and loses health.                                                                                                                          
### Dante worked on some design aspects of the page. CSS, and was the go-to debugger for the application. Also helped with setting up the initial sockets in the game.


# What were you able to complete for this handin?
### For this handin, we were able to integrate more aspects to the web game such as the status bar and the options picker. Other features such as the chat room were also set up. Also, during this handout, we went back and worked on our Handin 1 issues such as the log-in and pokeAPI.  

# What are known problems, if any, with your project?
### Right now, there is an issue with our Web App on Firefox as well as some functionalites of the log-in that are not working properly. 


# How would you improve it if you had more time?
### If given more time, we would have liked to fix the login as well as made it look asthetically pleasing, but we are confident we can finish that in the next handout.
