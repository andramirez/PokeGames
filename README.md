# What does your app do?
### We aim to deliver a real-time arena-type strategy game. The web app will provide social login to allow users to easily identify themselves, and include features such as a chat room, a game master chatbot, the game itself, an event log, and a media player to go along with our game.
### The goal of the game will be to traverse a digital grid in search of pokemon and items in order to out-survive and out-battle all the other players and be the last one standing.

# Who worked on it?

### Andrea Ramirez: Implemented PokeAPI, worked on Documentation and set up the PokeGames Set-Up page

# What were you able to complete for this handin?
### For this handin, we were able to set up the basic layout for our web game. We also were able to implement the spotify API. Since the theme is pokemon, we have a pokemon album queued up on spotify where users can listen to and game. 

# What are known problems, if any, with your project?
### Right now, there is a login glitch with spotify. Where it's prompting the user to sign in when selecting a song. Most likely due to an Oauth token error. Still researching


# How would you improve it if you had more time?
### If given more time, we would have liked to change more of the Set-Up Page, as well as the overall look of the game page. We would have liked to add more features at this point, but with the base that we have, we will be able to add the features that we initially wanted for the game page.
